<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm an SDET Engineer with 4 years of QA experience and a year of experience in web development. I'm always looking for ways to improve my testing and automate as much as possible. I've worked as a QA project lead for 2 years as well. I strive to constantly improve testing and automation in order to keep releases and deployments as seemless as possible.
